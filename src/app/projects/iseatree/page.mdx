## Project Overview
iSeaTree is a GIS-based mobile application for tree species identification and location tracking.
The application leverages computer vision AI and geospatial technologies to help users identify and document tree species in their environment, promoting environmental awareness and scientific curiousity.

## Technical Contributions

### Mobile Application Development
- Implemented cross-platform functionality using React Native
- Developed and maintained builds for both Android and iOS platforms
- Debuged info screen to display correct tree species information
- Implemented responsive UI components for optimal user experience

### AI Integration
- Configured and optimized API calls to computer vision services
- Developed logic to return both high-confidence matches while storing secondary possibilities for reference
- Conducted edge-case testing for computer vision features to improve accuracy, and heighten awareness of potential computer vision limitations

### GIS Dashboard
- Collaborated on the building of an interactive visualization dashboard using ReactJS
- Implemented real-time data processing for user submissions
- Researched possible data visualization techniques to enhance user exploration of data


## Technologies Used
- React Native
- ReactJS
- GIS mapping libraries
- Computer vision APIs - Plant.id
- Geolocation services
- Cross-platform testing tools - Expo, XCode, Android Studio
